Before the meeting:
==================
* Get the Flags
* Arrange the room by splitting up the tables:
  * put one table on one side and one on the other, both against the wall
  * As the boys arrive, try to have them distribute evenly between the tables.

As they are sitting down, have them draw pictures of things that they are doing to get ready for Christmas (decorate, go see Santa, etc.)

Gathering:
========
#### Skits
* Reshuffle the scouts into two groups, one on each end of the room, each group with a leader. Play the game independently of the other group. Play it over a couple of times, enough to leave about 5-10 minutes left in the meeting
* Choose a skit for each group to try. Have them practice it with their leader, then have them perform it for the other scouts.


Opening:
=======
* Flags
  * pick two scouts and one parent for each flag
  * have them bring both flags in from the hall and put them in the stands
* Pledge, Oath, Law
* move the flags to one corner of the room before proceeding with the meeting

Activities:
==========
### Before beginning the activities:
* Brief intro about ... "Do an activity to help your community or neighborhood team." (Team Tiger 5) -- Explain that we will be doing cleanup at the school in the spring like we did last year.
* shuffle the scouts into different groups:
  * We should have Den Chiefs (boy scouts) to help with activities tonight. If so, split them into 3 or 4 groups as necessary. Otherwise, if we don't have den chiefs, just split them into two groups.
  * Split up into stations. Rotate groups from station to station about every 10 minutes

### Stations (use the worksheets):
#### Tiger Adventure: Team Tiger
1. List the different teams of which you are a part.
2. With your den, make a den job chart that shows everyone doing something to help.
  * As one of the den jobs, lead the Pledge of Allegiance at a den meeting.
3. Pick two chores you will do at home once a week for a month.
4. Make a chart to show three ways that members of your Tiger team are different
from each other.

------------------

### Time for a game!
* Reshuffle the scouts into two groups, one on each end of the room, each group with a leader. Play the game independently of the other group. Play it over a couple of times for about 10-15 minutes, or enough to leave about 10-15 minutes left in the meeting (whichever is appropriate per their attention)

#### Hand Tap
Directions:
* Gather the group and tell them to form a close circle either kneeling on the floor or sitting around a table large enough to hold the whole group.
* Tell them to place their hands in front on them, with their palms down on the floor or on the table.
  * ___Game Tip:___ _After players have been eliminated, invite them to start another round or have them help to officiate the game._
* Have each person raise their right hand and place it over the left hand of the person to their right (so that each person’s left and right hands are separated by the right hand of the person on their left and the left hand of the person on their right).
* Explain that this is a tapping game. The goal is to tap hands in the order that hands are placed on the table or floor. For example, if Hannah began by tapping her left hand, it would be followed by Dalton’s right, Grace’s left, and then Hannah’s right.
* Play a few rounds, and then introduce a new element to the game:
  * Explain that anyone may reverse the order of the taps by double-tapping.
  * In other words, if Hannah taps her left hand, then Dalton taps his right, Grace can send the order back to Dalton by tapping her left hand twice. If this happens and Hannah raises her right hand by mistake, her right hand is out. (She must take it off the table or put it behind her back.) This continues until all but two players have been eliminated or until time runs out.

  -------------------

### And If Time Allows
* Do another Skit

  -------------------

### Wrap up --
* Reshuffle the scouts into two groups, one on each end of the room, each group with a leader. Do the following discussion independently of the other group.

Closing:
=====
* if time permits, play the Scout Oath Game from the beginning again.
* Oath, Law
* Flags
  * have two different scouts and one adult for each flag
  * after the oath and law, have those scouts carry the flags out to the hall

CLEAN UP!
