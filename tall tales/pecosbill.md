Pecos Bill was quite a cowboy down in Texas
And the western superman to say the least
He was the roughest, toughest critter
Never known to be a quitter
Cause he never had no fear of man or beast

Yippee-ai-ay-ai-ay
Yippee-ai-oh
For the toughest critter west of the Alamo

Once he roped a raging cyclone out of nowhere
Then he straddled it and settled down with ease
And while that cyclone bucked and flitted
Pecos stepped right up and saddled it
And he tamed that ornery wind down to a breeze

Yippee-ai-ay-ai-ay
Yippee-ai-oh
For the toughest critter west of the Alamo

Once there was a drought that spread all over Texas
So to sunny Californy he did go
And though the gag is kinda corny
He brought rain from Californy
That's the way we got the Gulf of Mexico

Yippee-ai-ay-ai-ay
Yippee-ai-oh
For the toughest critter west of the Alamo

Once a band of rustlers stole a herd of cattle
But they didn't know the herd they stole was Bill's
And when he caught them crooked villains
Pecos knocked out all their fillins
And that's the reason why there's gold in them there hills

Yippee-ai-ay-ai-ay
Yippee-ai-oh
For the toughest critter west of the Alamo

Pecos lost his way while travelin' on the desert
It was ninety miles across the burnin' sand
He knew he'd never reach the border
If he didn't get some water
So he got a stick and dug the Rio Grande

Yippee-ai-ay-ai-ay
Yippee-ai-oh
For the toughest critter west of the Alamo

While reclining on a cloud high over Texas
With his gun he made the stars evaporate
Then Pecos saw the stars declinin'
So he left one brightly shinin'
As the emblem of the Lone Star Texas state

Yippee-ai-ay-ai-ay
Yippee-ai-oh
For the toughest critter west of the Alamo
