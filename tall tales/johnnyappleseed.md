The lord is good to me
And so I thank the lord
For giving me the things I need
The sun and rain and an apple seed
Yes, he's been good to me

I owe the lord so much
For everything I see
I'm certain if it weren't for him
There'd be no apples on this limb
Oh, He's been good to me

I wake up every day as happy as can be
Because I know that with his care
My apple trees, they will still be there
Oh, the lord is good to me
