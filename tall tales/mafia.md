In its simplest form, Mafia is played by two teams: the mafia and the innocents. At the start of the game, every mafioso is given the identities of their teammates, whereas the innocents only receive the number of mafiosi in the game. Live games require a moderator who does not participate as a player.

There are two phases: night and day. At night, certain players secretly perform special actions; during day, players discuss and vote to "lynch," or eliminate, one player. These phases alternate with each other until all mafiosi have been eliminated or until the mafia outnumbers the innocents.

Some players may be given roles with special abilities. Common special roles include:

detective — an innocent who may learn the team of one player every night;
doctor — an innocent who may protect a player from being killed every night;
barman — a mafioso who may cancel the effect of another role's ability every night;
vigilante — an innocent who may kill a player every night.
Andrew Plotkin recommends having exactly two mafiosi,[3] whereas the original Davidoff rules suggest a third of the players (rounding to the nearest whole number) be mafiosi. Davidoff's original game does not include roles with special abilities.[1] In his rules for "Werewolf," Andrew Plotkin recommends that the first phase be day and that there be an odd number of players. These specifications prevent players from being killed before the first day and in most scenarios ensure that the game will end dramatically on a lynching rather than with an anticlimactic murder.[3]

Night[edit]
All players close their eyes. The moderator then instructs all members of the mafia to open their eyes and acknowledge their accomplices. The mafia members pick a "victim" by silently gesturing to indicate their target and to show unanimity then close their eyes again.

A similar process occurs for other roles with nightly actions. In the case of the detective, the moderator may indicate the target's innocence or guilt by using gestures such as nodding or head shaking.

Night may be accompanied by players tapping gently to mask sounds made by gesturing.[21]

Day[edit]

The moderator instructs players to open their eyes and announces who "died" the previous night. According to some rules, the role of the murdered player is revealed; according to others, it is not.[6][21] Dead players may not attempt to influence the game.

Discussion ensues. At any point, a player may accuse someone of being a mafioso and prompt others to vote to lynch them. If over half of the players do so, the accused person is eliminated, their role is revealed, and night begins. Otherwise, the phase continues until a lynching occurs.[3]

Because players have more freedom to deliberate, days tend to be longer than nights.
