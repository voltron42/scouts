Before the meeting:
==================
* Get the Flags

Activities:
==========
### Before beginning the activities:
* Brief intro about how all the activities go together (health), and (ask) how it relates to the scout oath (physically strong), and how it relates to 
* shuffle the scouts into different groups:
  * We should have Den Chiefs (boy scouts) to help with activities tonight. If so, split them into 3 or 4 groups as necessary. Otherwise, if we don't have den chiefs, just split them into two groups.
  * Split up into stations. Rotate groups from station to station about every 10 minutes

### Stations:
#### Fruits and Vegetables (Tiger Bites #2):
  * lay out the pictures of fruits and vegetables 52-card-pick-up style. Have the scouts try to sort them between fruit and vegetable. Talk about which ones they like and which ones they haven't tried.

#### Healthy vs Unhealthy (Tiger Bites #1):
* Talk about the pictures that the scouts drew at the beginning of the meeting. Talk about what makes them healthy or unhealthy

#### Importance of being active (Games Tigers Play #4 - last requirement)
* This one is for Dan Smith -- Talk to the scouts about the importance of being active. Ask them for some reasons why they think it is good to be active (benefits, etc)

#### Finger food (Tiger Bites #5)
* Ask the scouts for examples of food that you can eat with your fingers. Ask whether each food is healthy (apples, celery, carrots, etc) or unhealthy (chicken wings, etc)
  
------------------
  
### Time for a game!
* Reshuffle the scouts into two groups, one on each end of the room, each group with a leader. Play the game independently of the other group. Play it over a couple of times, enough to leave about 10-15 minutes left in the meeting

#### Forces of Flight Game
* First, briefly explain the forces involved in flying:
  * Thrust : The engines push the airplane forward
  * Drag : The resistance of the air which slows the plane down
  * Gravity:  The weight of the aircraft pulls it toward the ground
  * Lift: Air flowing over the wings moves the aircraft upward
* Have the Scouts stand in a line facing the leader. The leader shouts out one of the four forces of flight. The Scouts must do the action for the force as follows:
  * Thrust: Step foward
  * Drag: Step backward
  * Gravity: Fall down
  * Lift: Jump
* If you want to make this a competative game, you can have them be “out” if they don’t do the correct action or you can have them try to make progress toward a goal line. The winner is the leader for the next round.

-------------------

### Wrap up -- Chore discussion (includes Tiger Bites #3)
* Reshuffle the scouts into two groups, one on each end of the room, each group with a leader. Do the following discussion independently of the other group. 
  * ask the scouts (and their parents) if they had done a chore, and which chore they had done.
  * If they haven't done a chore, ask them what for ideas of what chores they could do. Ask them each to commit to a specific chore of their (and their parents) choice.

Closing:
=====
* if time permits, play the Scout Oath Game from the beginning again.
* Oath, Law
* Flags
  * have two different scouts and one adult for each flag
  * after the oath and law, have those scouts carry the flags out to the hall
