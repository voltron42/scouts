###Sleeping Guard Game
  Instructions
  1. Choose one Scout to be the sleeping guard. The rest will be thieves.
  2. The guard is blindfolded and sits on the ground next to the object to be stolen.
  3. The thieves start from a distance away and approach the object quietly to try to steal it. They must walk, not run.
  4. If the guard hears a thief approaching he points at them. If he correctly points to a thief, then that thief is out.
  5. If one of the thieves gets the object without being pointed out, he gets to be the guard for the next round.

###Forces of Flight Game
  First, briefly explain the forces involved in flying:
    Thrust : The engines push the airplane forward
    Drag : The resistance of the air which slows the plane down
    Gravity:  The weight of the aircraft pulls it toward the ground
    Lift: Air flowing over the wings moves the aircraft upward
  Have the Scouts stand in a line facing the leader. The leader shouts out one of the four forces of flight. The Scouts must do the action for the force as follows:
    Thrust: Run foward
    Drag: Run backward
    Gravity: Fall down
    Lift: Jump
  If you want to make this a competative game, you can have them be “out” if they don’t do the correct action or you can have them try to make progress toward a goal line. The winner is the leader for the next round.

###Shoot The Gap Game
  Materials
    Something to mark goal lines at the opposite ends of the playing area. You can also use natural boundaries, such as trees.
  The Game
    1. Divide the players into two groups.
    2. Explain the boundaries of play.
    3. Choose one person to be “The Guardian”. This person guards “The Gap” which is the area between the goal lines.
    4. The groups line up behind their goal lines.
    5. The Guardian shouts the name of a person on one of the teams. (Be specific – there might be more than one Jim.)
    6. Then the person whose name was shouted, shouts the name of someone on the opposite team.
    7. As soon as the second name is called, both players whose names were called run into the Gap.
    8. They try to get to the opposite goal, without being tagged by the Guardian. When they get there, they become a member of that group.
    9. If the Guardian tags someone, then the person who was tagged becomes the new Guardian. The previous Guardian joins the group the tagged person was running toward.
    10. Continue playing, making sure everyone gets a chance to participate.

###Spud
  Equipment
    1 playground ball
  Players
    One person is “It”
    Everyone else plays for themselves
  Instructions
    1. Each player is assigned a different number.
    2. Everyone gathers around It.
    3. It throws the ball straight up in the air and the players run away.
    4. While the ball is in the air, It calls a number and also runs away.
    5. The player who was assigned the number which It called must catch the ball, chasing it if necessary.
    6. When the person has control of the ball, he yells “Spud!” and everyone freezes.
    7. The person with the ball can take three giant steps toward any other player.  Then tries to hit one of the other players with the ball by throwing it. The players can try to dodge the ball by ducking or bending, but they must keep their feet planted.
    8. If a player is hit or if he moves his feet while dodging the ball,  he is assigned a letter – First S, then the second time P, then U, then D. He is also It.
    9. If the thrower misses, then he is It.
    10. When a player reaches SPUD with his letters, he is out of the game.
    11. Last player left in the game wins.
