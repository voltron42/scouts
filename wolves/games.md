Activity 3: Perpetual Motion

Play this team-building game. (Remember that Scouting is a safe haven for everybody; no one should be forced to play a game if he doesn’t feel physically or emotionally comfortable with it.)
Scouts sit in a circle on a large playing area with a smooth surface. Give each Scout a number, and put a flying disc or pie tin in the center of the circle. The first player walks to the disc, turns it on its edge and spins it like a coin. Returning to sit, he calls out the number of another player who must reach the disc before it stops spinning, give it another spin, and call another player’s number before sitting down. The object of the game is to keep the disc spinning as long as possible.


GATHERING

Washer Toss Game. Have the Scouts form a circle several feet in diameter. Give each boy five metal washers (if those aren’t available, you may substitute pennies, buttons, or wrapped hard candy). Place the container in the center of the circle, then go around the circle as each boy takes a turn throwing his washers. After he succeeds in tossing all five into the container, let him retrieve the washers and try tossing from a farther distance when his turn comes again.


GATHERING

Silent Red Light/Green Light Game. The entire game should be played in silence with Scouts tiptoeing quietly as they move. Select a leader from among the boys, or a den chief or adult leader. This person holds two sheets of paper—one red and one green—but stands with his back to the Scouts, who stand side by side at a starting line. The leader then raises one of the sheets over his head, and the boys silently do whatever the color indicates: “go” at green and “stop” at red. Each time he switches to the other sheet, the boys must switch to that action. The boys must all move at the same pace, and when one of them reaches the leader, that Scout becomes the leader for the next round. Remind everyone that “a Scout is trustworthy,” so a boy must return to the starting line if he goes or stops at the wrong time.
