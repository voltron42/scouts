RADIOACTIVE FIELD I
Materials: three boards (pieces of plywood work fine)
about a foot square
The goal is to transfer the entire group across an open,
flat area using three protective shields without touching
the ground with any body part. Boards must not be
thrown across the open area.

REVERSING PYRAMID
Have 10 people form a 4-3-2-1 horizontal pyramid
(arranged like bowling pins). Tell them to reverse the
apex and the base of the pyramid by moving only
three people.
